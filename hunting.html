<h1>Hunting</h1>

<p>Hunting is one of the many passions that I enjoy in the outdoors of Maine. Deer hunting is primarily my focus but I turkey hunt in the spring and hope to go bear hunting one day. Deer hunting is not about just the kill, but rather the experience of life in its own nature in the outdoors. Experiencing blending in with your surroundings and being one with nature is a truly meditating experience. I hunt every year to provide meat for my family and I, and have become quite the cook because of the amount of venison we use. I hope to get a deer this year to feed my family again.</p>
