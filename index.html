<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p1>My name is Luke Lapierre, and I am from Sanford, Maine. I attend the University of Maine but many of my hobbies revolve around the outdoors. My passions include hunting, fishiing, and mountain biking in remote locations throughout the state of Maine. Exploring the state is something I plan to do throughout my life whilst filling my passion. I hope to graduate from University of Maine with a business management degree and own my own business.</p1>
