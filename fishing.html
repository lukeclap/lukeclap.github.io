<h2>6LB Bass in Acton, Maine</h2>
<p>Fishing is a sport that I have practiced in hopes of becoming an expert since I was a kid. Over the years I have caught and released thousands of fish for the thrill of the sport. I am not only interested in catching fish, but also fish habits and what they do on a daily basis. How the environment effects fish and what they feed on in their habitats both interest me and are necessary for catching fish. I have learned the different feeding habits and patterns of different fish in my area to master the art of catching and releasing them.</p>
